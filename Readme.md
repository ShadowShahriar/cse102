# CSE 102: The Exposition

On **February 14, 2024**, I made a commitment to give my best performance in the CSE subject. I am passionate about programming, and I have chosen to study Computer Science and Engineering by myself. But achieving success in any field requires **knowledge**, **effort** and **persistence**.

While I have some coding knowledge, I understand the importance of consistent practice to improve my programming skills. Even basic problem-solving can go a long way, enabling me to solve complex problems.

> This repository is an open book containing all my solutions to CSE problems. Most of these tasks were assigned by our CSE lecturer,Â [**Nafis Saami Azad (NSAZ)**][1]. I am extremely thankful to him for mentoring me and 41 other students during the first semester of **Intake 53**.
