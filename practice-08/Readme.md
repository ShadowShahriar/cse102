# Practice 8: Facing My Worst Nightmare

> I always considered myself an average programmer and never believed I was qualified enough to win any programming contest. My self-doubt held me back from participating in any programming contest. I was afraid of failure (**aren't we all?**) and used to stress about seeing my submissions **"Accepted"** in bold green font. However, after practicing a handful of problems and learning some tricks, I gained enough confidence to participate in **BIUPC 2024** and ended up ranking [**52nd** in the main round][0].

Then I decided to take a step back and familiarize myself with **CodeForces**. My goal was to solve more problems and identify patterns, so I began from the very basics. Here are the problems I have solved so far:

-   [**F:** Digits Summation][3F]
-   [**G:** Summation from 1 to N][3G]
-   [**I:** Welcome for you with Conditions][3I]
-   [**J:** Multiples][3J]
