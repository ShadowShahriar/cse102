# Final Examination

> Our CSE lecturer, **NSAZ**, took an interesting approach to the final examination. To make the exam fun and challenging, he organized a contest on [**CodeForces**][1]. Since we are all fairly new to competitive programming, it was a memorable experience, and I learned a lot from it.

**Contest:** May 22, 2024 (from **02:00 PM** to **12:00 AM**)

[ðŸ“Œ **Problemset (Private)**][2]

## Problem B: Another magic string

One day there was a magician, who every day shows new magic. One day he asks for help to show you a new magic. The magic was that you are given a _string_ and two _characters_, All the First character in the string is replaced by the Second character, After that, you get a _string_. Now you have to reverse the string and print the string. Suppose a string _S = abcaea_. You have given a character-_a_ in the second line and the third line contains a character _z_ and you have to replace all the characters in the string a by z. Now the string _S = zbczez_. After that, you have to print the string in reverse which is _zezcbz_.

### Input

The first line contains a _string_. The second line contains a _character_ which character you want to replace in the string and The third line contains a _character_ that you use to replace.

-   `1` â‰¤ String length â‰¤ `100`.
-   `'a'` â‰¤ First Character â‰¤ Second character â‰¤ `'z'`.

### Output

Print the magic string.

### Examples

**Input**

```
abacad
a z
```

**Output**

```
The magic string: dzczbz
```

**Input**

```
babdbbbaddda
b x
```

**Output**

```
The magic string: adddaxxxdxax
```

## Problem D: C program to search all occurrences of a character in a string

Write a C program to search all occurrences of a character in a string using loop.

**Hints:**

-   How to find all occurrences of a character in a given string using for loop in C programming.
-   Program to print all index of a character in a given string.
-   Logic to search all occurrences of a character in given string in C program.

### Input

First line contains a string `S`.

Second line contains a character `C`.

### Output

Print all index of a character in the given string.

### Examples

**Input**

```
Hello, How are you?
e
```

**Output**

```c
'e' is found at index - 1
'e' is found at index - 13
```

**Input**

```
Nice to meet you buddy...
y
```

**Output**

```c
'y' is found at index - 13
'y' is found at index - 21
```

## Problem G: Trisection

Given an array of n integers, you have to split it into three non-empty sets in a way that the first set contains only negative integers, the second set contains only positive integers, the third set contains only zero.

Can you help Moon to write a program to divide the array satisfying these conditions?

### Input

First line contains an integer n (3 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 99), the size of the array.

Second line contains the elements of the array.

**Input**

```c
6
8 9 10 -4 -10 0
```

**Output**

```c
-4 -10
8 9 10
0
```
