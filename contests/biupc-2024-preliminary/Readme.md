# BIUPC 2024 (Preliminary)

> [**BUBT IT Club**][1] organized an exciting Intra University Programming Contest, and as a student of **Intake 53**, I was thrilled to participate in the **Junior** division. Since it was my first time participating in a programming contest, I learned a lot about competitive programming. This definitely gave me a taste of real-world programming problems.
